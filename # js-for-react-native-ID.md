## Tasks

### Task 1: processArray Function
- Created a JavaScript file named `arrayManipulation.js`.
- Implemented the `processArray` function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.

### Task 2: formatArrayStrings Function
- Added the `formatArrayStrings` function to `arrayManipulation.js`.
- This function takes two arrays: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`. It modifies each string based on its corresponding number: capitalizes the entire string if the number is even, or converts the string to lowercase if the number is odd.

### Task 3: createUserProfiles Function
- Created a JavaScript file named `userInfo.js`.
- Implemented the `createUserProfiles` function that takes an array of names and an array of modified names from Task 2. It returns an array of objects, each containing `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and `id` (auto-incremented starting from 1).

### Task 4: README
- Added a README file with student ID and explanations of each task.
